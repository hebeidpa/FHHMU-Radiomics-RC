# FHHMU-Radiomics-RC
Radiomics-based ensemble model predicts postoperative recurrence of gastric cancer
## Overview
## This project mainly covers two core modules:
- GastricNN-UNet: A nnU-Net-based CT segmentation model for gastric medical imaging. 
- R: A pipeline for constructing ensemble models from medical data and gastric medical imaging data.
## GastricNN-UNet
- GastricNN-UNet A customized implementation of the nnU-Net framework for 3D CT image segmentation focusing on gastric structures. 
- Key features:
  
      Preprocessing pipelines optimized for abdominal CT scans. 

      Configuration files for gastric organ/tumor segmentation. 

      Trained model weights (optional, contact for access).
